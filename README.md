# Public-Accounting-Fraud-Prediction

## General Info:
This repository contains my work on improving upon leading accounting research specifically in the field of predicting the likelyhood of public accounting fraud in the form of financial misstatements.

## Technologies Used:
This project uses:
* Python: 3.3
* Jupyter Notebook

## Next Steps:
Calculate sentiment and obfuscation in 10K filings' MD&A section using French NLP Python package 'Pattern'. Is there a higher degree of obfuscation in management langauge in the filings of companies who are engaging in accounting fraud?
